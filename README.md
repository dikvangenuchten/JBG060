This will install all the correct version of the packages used.
4.	Add source root to pythonpath
5.	Put the four zipped folders inside â€¦/source_root/data
6.	Run: python main.py \
This will run: \
    1.	The preprocessing steps needed\
    2.	The simulation and train the needed models\
    3.	The visualization present in the poster
      
To run a simulation of how the current system works set dumb in main.py to true

Useful functions/folders that can be ripped out to get a head start:
Preprocessing: Unzipify.py automatically unzips all folders
digital_twin: A low key simulation of the sewage system, can keep track of the internal 
volume of water when testing your own models, and writes a summary to file every step.
